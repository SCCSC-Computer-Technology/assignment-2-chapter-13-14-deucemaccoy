I would reccomend adding more comments. While I can figure out what your code does, it would greatly speed up the process if some sections had explainations, or if methods were labeled. I also find that commenting my code actually helps me learn and understand my own code better. 

The radio buttons were a good choice, it organizes the form, and adds some error handling.

I would also reccomend organizing the code a little differently. For example: the 'private void' methods can be kept as-is, but re-ordered. So either group the methods by 'Product/Inventory/Unit Search' or perhaps group them by radio buttons & search buttons.

Lastly, I used DataGridView instead of the listbox for the results. I was having the same issue with the text being missaligned, and found the DataGridView solved that for me, and provided some extra (optional) useful settings.

These are little things, but will pay dividends for when other people look at your code + improve readability.
